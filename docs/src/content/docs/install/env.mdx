description: How to configure Hollo using environment variables.

import { Aside, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Hollo is configured using environment variables.  You can set them in an *.env*
file in the root directory of the project, or you can set them using Docker's
`-e`/`--env` option or Railway's environment variables.


Basic settings
--------------

### `PORT` <Badge text="Optional" /> <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

The port number to listen on.  3000 by default.

### `DATABASE_URL` <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

The URL of the PostgreSQL database, e.g.,
`postgresql://hollo:password@localhost/hollo`.

### `SECRET_KEY` <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

The secret key for securing the session.  You can generate a random secret key
using the following command:

~~~~ sh frame="none"
openssl rand -hex 32
~~~~

### `BEHIND_PROXY` <Badge text="Optional" /> <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

Set this to `true` if Hollo is behind a reverse proxy.  If you place the Hollo
behind an L7 load balancer (you usually should do this), turn this on.

Turned off by default.

<Aside>
  With this option, Hollo will trust the `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`,
  and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers from the reverse proxy.  This is important for
  security reasons.
</Aside>

### `ALLOW_PRIVATE_ADDRESS` <Badge text="Optional" />

Setting this to `true` disables SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) protection.

Turn on to test in local network.

Turned off by default.

<Aside>
  Turning on this option is dangerous security-wise.  Only use this option in
  a trusted environment and never in production.
</Aside>


Additional features
-------------------

###  `HOME_URL` <Badge text="Optional" />

If present, the home page will redirect to this URL.  If not set, the home page
will show the list of accounts on the instance.

### `REMOTE_ACTOR_FETCH_POSTS` <Badge text="Optional" />

The number of recent public posts to fetch from remote actors when they are
encountered first time.

`10` by default.


Logging and debugging
---------------------

### `LOG_LEVEL` <Badge text="Optional" />

The log level for the application.  `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and
`fatal` are available.

`info` by default.

### `LOG_QUERY` <Badge text="Optional" />

Set this to `true` to log SQL queries.

Turned off by default.

### `SENTRY_DSN` <Badge text="Optional" />

The DSN of the Sentry project to send error reports and traces to.


Asset storage
-------------

### `DRIVE_DISK`

The disk driver used by Hollo to store blobs such as avatars, custom emojis,
and other media.

Valid values are `fs` (local filesystem) and `s3` (S3-compatible object storage).

Defaults to `s3` for backward compatibility, but it is recommended to explicitly
configure the driver as the default value will be removed in the future.

See the [FlyDrive docs] for details about the drivers.

<Aside type="caution">
  If you change the `DRIVE_DISK` and related settings of a running Hollo during
  production, existing files are not moved; only new files are stored according
  to the new settings.

  Also, keep in mind that existing files will still be served according to the
  old settings, so if you change `S3_BUCKET`, for example, they will still be
  served from the old bucket and should not be deleted.

### Local filesystem settings

#### `FS_ASSET_PATH` <Badge text="Required with FS driver" variant="note" />

The path in the local filesystem where blob assets are stored, e.g.,
`/var/lib/hollo`.

<Aside>
  - Directory must exist and be writable by the Hollo process.
  - Recommended permissions: 755 for directories, 644 for files.
  - Ensure sufficient storage capacity for your use case.
  - Regular backups are strongly recommended.
  - When using Docker, ensure the path is properly mounted.
</Aside>

### S3-compatible object storage settings

<Aside>
  These settings are only required when `DRIVE_DISK=s3`.

  Ensure your AWS IAM policy grants the following permissions:

  - `s3:PutObject`
  - `s3:GetObject`
  - `s3:DeleteObject`
  - `s3:ListBucket`
</Aside>

#### `ASSET_URL_BASE` <Badge text="Required with S3 driver" variant="caution" />

The public URL base of the asset storage, e.g.,
`https://hollo.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

<Aside type="caution">
  - HTTPS is required in production environments.
  - Must be publicly accessible for federation to work correctly.
</Aside>

#### `S3_REGION` <Badge text="Optional" />

The region of the S3-compatible object storage, e.g., `us-east-1`.  On some
non-S3 services, this can be omitted.  `auto` by default.

#### `S3_BUCKET` <Badge text="Required with S3 driver" variant="caution" />

The bucket name of the S3-compatible object storage, e.g., `hollo`.

#### `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` <Badge text="Required with S3 driver" variant="caution" />

The endpoint URL for S3-compatible object storage, e.g.,
`https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

#### `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` <Badge text="Optional" />

Whether to force path-style URLs for S3-compatible object storage.  `true` to
turn on, `false` to turn off.  Useful for non-AWS S3-compatible services.
Turned off by default.

#### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` <Badge text="Required with S3 driver" variant="caution" />

The access key for S3-compatible object storage.

#### `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` <Badge text="Required with S3 driver" variant="caution" />

The secret key for S3-compatible object storage.
