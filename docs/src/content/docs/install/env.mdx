description: How to configure Hollo using environment variables.

import { Aside, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Hollo is configured using environment variables.  You can set them in an *.env*
file in the root directory of the project, or you can set them using Docker's
`-e`/`--env` option or Railway's environment variables.

### `LISTEN_PORT` <Badge text="Optional" /> <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

The port number to listen on.  3000 by default.

### `DATABASE_URL` <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

The URL of the PostgreSQL database, e.g.,
`postgresql://hollo:password@localhost/hollo`.

### `REDIS_URL` <Badge text="Optional" /> <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

The URL of the Redis server, e.g., `redis://localhost/0`.

If not set, Hollo will use PostgreSQL for caching and message queueing.

###  `HOME_URL` <Badge text="Optional" />

If present, the home page will redirect to this URL.  If not set, the home page
will show the list of accounts on the instance.

### `SECRET_KEY` <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

The secret key for securing the session.  You can generate a random secret key
using the following command:

~~~~ sh frame="none"
openssl rand -hex 32
~~~~

### `REMOTE_ACTOR_FETCH_POSTS` <Badge text="Optional" />

The number of recent public posts to fetch from remote actors when they are
encountered first time.

`10` by default.

### `LOG_LEVEL` <Badge text="Optional" />

The log level for the application.  `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and
`fatal` are available.

`info` by default.

### `LOG_QUERY` <Badge text="Optional" />

Set this to `true` to log SQL queries.

Turned off by default.

### `BEHIND_PROXY` <Badge text="Optional" /> <Badge text="Unused in Railway" variant="tip" />

Set this to `true` if Hollo is behind a reverse proxy.  If you place the Hollo
behind an L7 load balancer (you usually should do this), turn this on.

Turned off by default.

<Aside>
  With this option, Hollo will trust the `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`,
  and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers from the reverse proxy.  This is important for
  security reasons.
</Aside>

### `ALLOW_PRIVATE_ADDRESS` <Badge text="Optional" />

Setting this to `true` disables SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) protection.

Turn on to test in local network.

Turned off by default.

<Aside>
  Turning on this option is dangerous security-wise.  Only use this option in
  a trusted environment and never in production.
</Aside>

### `S3_REGION` <Badge text="Optional" />

The region of the S3-compatible object storage, e.g., `us-east-1`.  On some
non-S3 services, this can be omitted.  `auto` by default.

### `S3_BUCKET`

The bucket name of the S3-compatible object storage, e.g., `hollo`.

### `S3_URL_BASE`

The public URL base of the S3-compatible object storage, e.g.,
`https://hollo.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

### `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`

The endpoint URL for S3-compatible object storage, e.g.,
`https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

### `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`

Whether to force path-style URLs for S3-compatible object storage.  `true` to
turn on, `false` to turn off.  Useful for non-AWS S3-compatible services.
Turned off by default.

### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

The access key for S3-compatible object storage.

### `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

The secret key for S3-compatible object storage
