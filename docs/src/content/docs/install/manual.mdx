Hollo can be installed manually on your server.  This guide will walk you
through the process of setting up Hollo on your server.  It assumes you have
some experience with running web applications and are comfortable with the
command line.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you are not comfortable with Unix-like systems or prefer a more automated
  way to deploy Hollo, you can use [Railway] to deploy Hollo with just a few
  clicks.

  [Railway]: /install/railway
