description: How to deploy Hollo using Docker.
---

Hollo provides the official Docker images on [GitHub Packages].  You can use
them to deploy Hollo on your server or your local machine:

~~~~ sh frame="none"
docker pull ghcr.io/dahlia/hollo:latest
~~~~

To run Hollo, you need to set up a PostgreSQL database and
an S3-compatible object storage for media storage.  You can use the
official Docker image for [PostgreSQL], and you can use
[MinIO] for the S3-compatible object storage.  Or you can use other
managed services like AWS [RDS], [ElastiCache], and [S3].

To connect Hollo to these services, you need to set the environment
variables through `docker run` command's [`-e`/`--env` option or
`--env-file` option][1].  To list the environment variables that Hollo
supports, see the [*Environment variables*](/install/env) chapter.

Docker Compose
--------------

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import composeYaml from "./docker/compose-yaml?raw";

To wire up these services, you can use [Docker Compose].  Here's an example
*compose.yaml* file:

<Code code={composeYaml} lang="yaml" title="compose.yaml" />

Save this file as *compose.yaml* in your working directory, and then run
the following command:

~~~~ sh frame="none"
docker compose up -d
~~~~
