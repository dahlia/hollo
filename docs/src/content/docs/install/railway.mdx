[![Deploy on Railway][]][Railway template]

The easiest way to deploy Hollo is to use [Railway].  Railway is a platform that
allows you to deploy your apps with ease. It supports a variety of languages and
frameworks, including Node.js, Python, Ruby, and more.

Click the button above to deploy Hollo on Railway.  With this template, you can
get started with your own Hollo in just a few clicks.

To deploy Hollo, you need S3 or S3-compatible object storage for storing media
such as images.  There are many S3-compatible object storage services,
including AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, and Linode Object
Storage.  Once you have your object storage ready, you'll need to configure
the environment variables appropriately (see how to use the S3 client API
for each service).  For more information, see the
[*Environmnet variables*](./env) chapter.

Once you've set up your environment variables and Hollo is deployed on Railway,
go to https://yourdomain/setup to set up your login credentials and add your
profile.

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  You need to decide on a domain name *before* you start setting up Hollo for
  the first time. This is because *you can't change your domain name once
  Hollo is set up.*
</Aside>

Once you've created your profile, you're ready to start enjoying Hollo.
It's worth noting that Hollo doesn't have much of a web interface of its own,
so you'll need to use a client app like [Phanpy] for now.
