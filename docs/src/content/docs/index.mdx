  <Card title="For single-users" icon="seti:lock">
    Hollo is designed for single-users, so you can own your instance
    and have full control over your data. It's perfect for personal microblogs,
    notes, and journals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple accounts" icon="seti:folder">
    Although Hollo is designed for single-users, you can have multiple accounts
    on the same instance. You can switch between accounts easily, and each
    account has its own profile, posts, and settings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mastodon-compatible API" icon="puzzle">
    Hollo is headless; instead, it complies with the [Mastodon API],
    so that you can use any Mastodon-compatible client to interact with it.

    [Mastodon API]: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/
  </Card>
  <Card title="CommonMark" icon="seti:markdown">
    You can compose your posts in [CommonMark] (so-called Markdown),
    and Hollo will render them for you&mdash;of course, other fediverse software
    will render them as well.  Moreover, you're allowed up to 4,096 characters
    per post.

    [CommonMark]: https://commonmark.org/
  </Card>
  <Card title="Misskey-style quotes" icon="comment">
    Hollo supports [Misskey]-style quotes, so you can quote other posts
    in your own posts. It's compatible with other fediverse software that
    supports Misskey-style quotes, e.g., Misskey, [Akkoma], [Fedibird],
    [Threads].

    [Misskey]: https://misskey-hub.net/
    [Akkoma]: https://akkoma.social/
    [Fedibird]: https://github.com/fedibird/mastodon
    [Threads]: https://www.threads.net/
  </Card>
  <Card title="Misskey-style emoji reactions" icon="heart">
    Hollo supports [Misskey]-style emoji reactions, so you can react to posts
    with Unicode emojis and custom emojis. It's compatible with other fediverse
    software that supports Misskey-style emoji reactions, e.g., Misskey,
    [Akkoma].

  <Card title="Powered by Fedify" icon="deno">
    Hollo is powered by [Fedify], an ActivityPub server framework for TypeScript.
