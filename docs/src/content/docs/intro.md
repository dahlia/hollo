title: What is Hollo?
description: Hollo is a federated microblogging software for single-users.

Hollo is a simple, single-user microblogging tool that lets you run your own
little corner of the internet. Think of it as your personal Mastodon instance,
but stripped down to the essentials.

What makes Hollo stand out is that it's part of the [fediverse]--a network of
interconnected servers running on open protocols, primarily [ActivityPub].
This means you can connect and interact with folks on other platforms like:

 -  [Mastodon]
 -  [Misskey]
 -  [Akkoma]
 -  [WordPress]
 -  [Threads]
 -  And many other fediverse servers

So you get the calm of your own space, but you're still connected to a wider
community.

Features
--------

Hollo boasts feature parity with Mastodon for most individual user needs.
You get all the core microblogging features you'd expect, minus the stuff that
doesn't make sense for a single-user instance (like moderation tools).
This means you can:

 -  Use hashtags and mentions
 -  Share media attachments
 -  Create polls
 -  Share and favorite posts

When it comes to writing your posts, Hollo keeps things flexible. You can:

 -  Write posts up to 4,096 characters long
 -  Use [CommonMark] (so-called Markdown) for easy formatting
 -  Use Misskey-style quotes to add some flair to your posts

Hollo is what we call "headless," which is a techy way of saying it doesn't have
its own web interface. Instead, you can use any Mastodon-compatible app to post
and interact. This might sound odd at first, but it actually gives you
the freedom to pick an app that suits your style.

In essence, Hollo is a straightforward tool that brings the power of Mastodon
to individual users. It helps you share thoughts online--from quick updates to
longer musings--connect with others in the fediverse, and do it all on your own
terms. It's not aiming to be the next big social network--it's just here to
make microblogging a bit easier and more connected.

Etymology
---------

The name *Hollo* is from a Korean word *홀로*, which means *alone* or
*solitary*.  It is named so because it is designed to be a single-user software.
