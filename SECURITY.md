Security policy
===============

Supported versions
------------------

We support the latest two minor versions of the library. For example, if the
latest version is 1.2.3, we support 1.2.x and 1.1.x.


Reporting a vulnerability
-------------------------

If you think you have found a security issue, please *do not* open a public
issue.  Instead, please open a private vulnerability report by [creating a new
draft security advisory][1].

We will review your report and respond within 48 hours.
